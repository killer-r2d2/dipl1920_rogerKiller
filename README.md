###ABSTRACT / MANAGEMENT SUMMARY:



###SETUP GUIDE:
1. npm install
2. gulp watch
3. gulp build
4. happy coding 

###URL (OPERATIVE VERSION):
http://deepdevdiver.com/

###TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION:
1. To embed the google map on the detailsite of the festival, I used
the google Maps JavaScript API (// https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview)
, i also watched a turtorial to learn the basics()
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxf1mnP5zcw&feature=emb_rel_pause) This was the first time I used an API like this.
I struggled a bit until I figured out that I had to register myself first.

2. The slider story. To embed the slider of the detailsite, I watched a youtube tutorial
of Dev Ed (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcdBOoK3Pfw&t=1334s). I've learned a few basics to build a slider
and the result worked fine on the desktop version but not on mobile. After a conversation with my friends at Mosaix,
they advised me to use one of the below: 

- https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/
- https://splidejs.com/
- and a self made slider of Mosaix

I tried all three (time: 3 days), but none of them worked fine at the end.

It was really frustrating.
So, I decieded to go back to my youtube slider.
The javaScript for the slider is commented out (at the moment), if you like to activate the slider,
go to main.js and remove the comment.
It might have been wise to learn this at school.

3. I wasn't able to implement the masonry for the newsSection and magazinSection.
So I decided to use flexbox for the newsSection and css-grid for the magazinSection.

4. The pngs for the discovery Section were not available.
My school made Beda BÃ¤chler has organized these for the class. I now owe him a beer.

###TECHNOLOGY CONCEPT (INCL. EVALUATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY, AND JUSTIFICATION):

see above (TECHNOLOGY CHOICE)


###SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK, PERSONAL NOTE:

I started to work for my DIPLOMA THESIS right after the briefing. My plan was:

1. Build the html structure for all sites/elements.
2. Implement the css for mobile.
3. Implement the css for desktop.
4. Implement javascript.
5. Organize the Hosting.
6. Done.

At point 2, I realized that my approach took too much time. I started the implementing of
desktop and mobile version at the same time. That way I had not to edit everything twice. 
To start with javaScript was hard, it had been a while that we used it at school.
I was able to refresh it at the free coding sessions with my classmates (thanks dudes).
Until the first school day after holidays, I was on the right track.
On the remaining four school days I was able to get some important inputs,
thanks to Killian for his patience.

Today is the 28.08.2020, 12:26pm. I haven't finished everything, but I have done my best and 
I'm proud of my work. During this time I've learned a lot, applying the school's knowledge to a project was a very 
good experience. It gave me more confidence with the different languages and technologies.
I really enjoyed working on this project, it confirmed that I enjoy realizing designs/things.
When I think back to the time when I started my education (Web Integrator 2019), until now, I have been
taught an enormous amount of knowledge. Sometimes I feel like a Flowerpot that is filled with soil, and someone
waters it, but the soil can no longer absorb water and needs time to soak it up (does that make any sense?).

Anyway, I will continue to follow the path as a web developer in the future, because it feels right.


PS: Thanks to:
- All teachers of Web Professionals
- My girlfriend Michaela for kicking my ass
- My classmates
- My family
- The Mosaix crew
- And all other supporters I've forgot
